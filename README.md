HTMLPresenter
=============
Every computer has browser, normally even more than one. The idea of this system is to turn your browser into a slide show presenter, without the need of installing softwares onto your computer, consuming the memory of your computer and you can do it anywhere you go with any computer!

Therefore, this system will allow you to create, edit, save and present your work in a modern browser. The languages you'll need to know are the basic of web development: html, javascript and css. Those are pretty easy to learn. 

Benefit
=======
The good thing of using html to render the content of your presentation is that you'll be able to use all your knowledge from html to do whatever you need to do, be it making animation on your slide, a set of radio buttons to perform different actions on one slide, including a checkbox, and many more, just whatever you can use your web to do!

Development
===========
At the early stage of development, this system will utilise XMLHTTPRequest to write the file. However, this means a local server will be needed to edit and save the presentation. This will hopefully be improved to eliminate the need of a server-side request or script.

The final aim of the system will be a standalone system, which you can just copy and paste to use it on any of the computer.
